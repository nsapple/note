        <div class="answer">○ The song and video share the same message of ending violence in Chicago</div>
        
        <div class="question">● What does the video make you feel?</div>
        <div class="answer">○ The video pans across memorial art of murder victims, and school children. This shows the community is vulnerable and the youth is susceptible to violence. This makes me feel empathy for all the victims and children.</div>
        
        <div class="question">● Is the artist using paths, ethos, and or logos?</div>
        <div class="answer">○ In my opinion the artist is using all 3. The artist shows statistics of victims to murder, memorials of the victims, and children dancing to the song.</div>

    <h2>Street Art Analysis</h2>

    <div class="analysis-box">
        <h3>Artwork 1: Guernica (1937) by Pablo Picasso</h3>
        
        <div class="question">1. What is the message of this artwork?</div>
        <div class="answer">a. The central message of Guernica is a (complete/harsh/simple) strong criticism of the animal-like violence, suffering, and noise and confusion of war. It stands as a universal symbol of peace and a protest against violence. Picasso uses the event to show the for no reason/unconscious very cruel nature of of battle, which results in the careless murder of innocent people.</div>
        
        <div class="question">2. What does art make you feel and think?</div>
        <div class="answer">a. The artwork brings out feelings of shock, horror, and deep sadness. The black-and-white colors create a sad, funeral-like mood, highlighting grief and despair. It makes the viewer face the pain of war, showing scary scenes of screaming people, broken bodies, and suffering animals. This leads us to think about the real cost of war beyond politics.</div>
        
        <div class="question">3. Is the artist using pathos (emotion), logos (logical thinking) and/or ethos (credibility of the author/artist) to communicate their message?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            a. <strong>Pathos (Emotion):</strong> Picasso mainly uses emotions to share his message. The twisted, painful faces, the mother crying over her dead child, and the scared horse all make viewers feel strong emotions. The whole picture shows raw pain and suffering, making it hard to respond calmly or logically.<br><br>
            b. <strong>Logos (Logic):</strong> Though not the main focus, the chaotic scene logically argues against war by showing its harmful and senseless effects. By showing victims like women, children, and animals, Picasso clearly proves that bombing is unjustifiable because it harms everyone without reason.<br><br>
            c. <strong>Ethos (Credibility):</strong> Picasso's reputation as a respected and influential artist gives the work credibility. His public statement against the fascist regime, expressed through his art, lent significant weight to the anti-war movement and gave the art a powerful ethical foundation.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">4. Is there any coded language or imagery (language or imagery that has a special meaning in this context or for the audience the artist is speaking to)?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            a. <strong>Bull:</strong> A symbol with many meanings. It can represent Spanish tradition, masculinity, or violence. Some see it as the fascist forces attacking an innocent horse.<br><br>
            b. <strong>Wounded horse:</strong> Often seen as a sign of the suffering Spanish people, innocence, or humanity being hurt by fascist cruelty.<br><br>
            c. <strong>Broken sword:</strong> This shows that old-fashioned heroism is gone and modern war makes it impossible for individuals to fight honorably.
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="analysis-box">
        <h3>Artwork 2: The Liberation of Aunt Jemima (1972) by Betye Saar</h3>
        
        <div class="question">5. What is the message of this artwork?</div>
        <div class="answer">a. Saar's work changes the mammy stereotype into a strong, active figure. It sends a clear and sharp message about American racism, the long history of treating Black women unfairly, and the need for freedom. The artwork takes back the identity of a character once used to support and comfort a system of white supremacy.</div>
        
        <div class="question">6. What does art make you feel and think?</div>
        <div class="answer">a. The piece brings up strong feelings like anger, discomfort, and defiance. Some people might feel shocked or uneasy seeing Aunt Jemima, who usually smiles, now holding a weapon. Others may see it as a sign of strength and justified anger. The image makes people think about how a stereotype that seems harmless can actually be harmful and pushes them to reflect on America's racial history.</div>
        
        <div class="question">7. Is the artist using pathos (emotion), logos (logical thinking) and/or ethos (credibility of the author/artist) to communicate their message?</div>
        <div class="answer">a. Saar creates strong feelings by showing a familiar, friendly figure holding weapons. This surprises viewers and goes against what they expect. Having a smiling face with a powerful pose makes people feel uneasy and draws attention to how unfair the original stereotype is.<br><br>
            b. The use of found objects like the Aunt Jemima figurine and images from popular culture provides a logical, documented critique of how systemic racism is propagated through everyday commercial items. The artwork is a rational, evidence-based argument about the insidious nature of racist iconography.<br><br>
            c. As a Black artist from the Civil Rights era, Saar's personal experience lends credibility to the work. She speaks from a position of lived experience, challenging the dominant cultural narrative with an authentic, authoritative voice. The inclusion of other found objects, like a small photograph, may also be an appeal to personal and communal history.
        </div>
        
        <div class="question">8. Is there any coded language or imagery (language or imagery that has a special meaning in this context or for the audience the artist is speaking to)?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            a. <strong>Aunt Jemima figurine:</strong> This is the central symbol, representing the history of racism and the dehumanization of Black women in America.<br><br>
            b. <strong>Broom and rifle:</strong> The transformation of the mammy figure is made explicit through the tools she holds. The broom, a symbol of domesticity and servitude, is replaced or joined by a rifle and a grenade, symbols of militancy and revolution.<br><br>
            c. <strong>Miniature photograph:</strong> The small, historic photograph on the figure's chest could represent the personal histories and identities erased by racist caricatures.
        </div>

    <div class="analysis-box">
        <h3>Artwork 3: The Dinner Party (1974-1979) by Judy Chicago</h3>
        
        <div class="question">9. What is the message of this artwork?</div>
        <div class="answer">a. This message celebrates women's history and talks about all the awesome things women have done, even though they've often been ignored or not given credit. It says women should be included in history, not left out, and wants to change the usual story that's mostly about men.</div>
        
        <div class="question">10. What does art make you feel and think?</div>
        <div class="answer">a. The installation makes people feel amazed, inspired, and powerful. When you see how big it is and how much detail went into each woman's spot, it makes you feel proud and realize how important it is. It gets you thinking about all the things women have done in history and how they've often been left out.</div>
        
        <div class="question">11. Is the artist using pathos (emotion), logos (logical thinking) and/or ethos (credibility of the author/artist) to communicate their message?</div>
        <div class="answer">a. The feelings come from all the stories and history shown together. People might feel connected, like they share something with the women being honored. The careful, handmade details on each plate and runner also make it feel more personal and emotional.</div>
        
        <div class="question">12. Is there any coded language or imagery (language or imagery that has a special meaning in this context or for the audience the artist is speaking to)?</div>
        <div class="answer">a. <strong>Triangular table:</strong> The shape is important and has a meaning. It shows how women have often been left out of important decisions, since they weren't invited to the "round tables." The triangle also stands for the female symbol.</div>
